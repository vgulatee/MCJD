The pulse peak is well above the transition current, and usually one drop is transferred during each pulse. The combination of the two levels of current produces a steady arc with axial spray transfer at effective welding currents below those required for conventional spray arc welding.

Ionic substances can be broken down by electricity. … For electrolysis to work, the ions must be free to move. Ions are free to move when an ionic substance is dissolved in water or molten (melted). For example, if electricity is passed through copper chloride solution, the copper chloride is broken down to form copper metal and chlorine gas. … Here is what happens during electrolysis: Positively charged ions move to the negative electrode during electrolysis. They receive electrons and are reduced. Negatively charged ions move to the positive electrode during electrolysis.

To maintain a steady-state metal concentration in the stagnant rinse at or below the maximum contaminant concentration, the rate of metal deposition onto the electrowinning cathodes must be greater than or equal to the rate of dragin from the preceding tank. Thus, the metal deposition rate is an essential design parameter that ultimately affects the capacity, size and cost of the electrowinning unit. ... Because metal and cyanide concentration in the stagnant rinse are lowered, subsequent rinses will be cleaner, allowing the flow rates in these rinses to be reduced or turned off. In many cases, rinse water flow is reduced to a rate equal to the evaporation rate from the stagnant rinse."

The platform's six legs each have two parts, an upper and a lower leg, with a piston-like cylindrical DoF between each pair of parts. The legs are connected to the base plate and the top plate by universal joints at each end of each leg. (These universals are not just sets of abstract DoFs. Each also contains a spider-like body, while also having two DoFs.) The upper part of each leg can slide into and out of the lower leg, allowing each leg to be varied in length. The position and orientation of the mobile platform (top plate) varies depending on the lengths to which the six legs are separately adjusted. Once the top is connected to the legs, the entire Stewart platform assembly has 36 DoFs. Only six DoFs are independent, the same as the top plate would have if it were disconnected. You can think of these independent DoFs as the six adjustable leg lengths or as equivalent to the six DoFs of the mobile plate."||"OBS: Geodetic Technology trademarked  hexapod for a Stewart platform in a machine tool context.

CNC versions of this machine allow an operator to alter the pressures during the bending cycle and thus create an elliptical shape or a bend with multiple bend radius.
Metal Forming||rotary piercing||CORRECT||||||||||DEF: A term used in reference to a method of producing metal tubes (usually in iron or steel or certain non-ferrous metals) from a hot billet. The billet is guided between a pair of rolls that are bevelled and inclined at a small angle to one another. This ensures that the billet is gripped and spun at high speed as it is forced over a tapered plug. This latter opens up the hole in the billet. The rough pierced blank is plug rolled to improve the shape of the tube.

This process is commonly called thixoforming (thixocasting or thixoforging) and possesses some of the advantages of both casting and forging. Initially the material behaves in the semi-solid condition like a solid (it can be picked up and holds it shape unsupported), but when injected into a die it flows like a liquid to take the form of the die accurately, as in die-casting. However, the structure is fine and uniform, virtually free of porosity, and the product may be heat-treated to give mechanical properties superior to those of castings. The thermal shock to the die is less than that given by a liquid, which means that higher melting point alloys - which cannot easily be diecast - may nevertheless be thixocast."

This has lead to a growing use of duplex stainless steels as a material in mechanically loaded constructions. However, detailed knowledge regarding its mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms are still lacking. In this project special emphasis has been placed on the residual stresses and their influence on mechanical behaviour of duplex stainless steels. Due to the difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the two phases, tensile microstresses are found in the austenitic phase and balancing compressive microstresses in the ferritic phase."||"CONT: at elevated temperatures carbon exists in a solid solution with iron; this is the austenitic phase, and the steel would be soft and weak."||OBS: austenite: Gamma iron with carbon in solution.

Metallurgy - General||liquid film migration of grain boundaries||CORRECT||||||||||"CONT: ... the UAB [University of Alabama at Birmingham] team probed deeper into the welding process and made a fundamental metallurgical discovery - constitutional liquid film migration - a phenomenon that Dr. Thompson says would not have been found without the Gleeble. In the 1980's, researchers working in solid state electronic devices discovered diffusion-induced grain boundary migration, in which diffusion of elements from the top layer of a device would cause the grain boundaries to move in unpredictable directions. Five years later, other investigators found that running a liquid along the grain boundary could also cause it to move. Then, in the course of their NASA-related research, Dr. Thompson and his colleagues discovered that liquid film migration of grain boundaries occurred naturally during welding as the result of precipitates liquating in the heat affected zone. The UAB team further found that the migration distance was an order of magnitude greater than previously observed and that new grains were actually formed during the process. Spurred on by this discovery, the UAB researchers looked at real-world welding processes and found that constitutional liquid film migration could be found there too."
Metallurgy - General||liquid film migration||CORRECT||||||||||"CONT: Discontinuous precipitation (DP) occurs in many alloy systems under certain conditions. It is called discontinuous precipitation because precipitation occurs on prior matrix grain boundaries followed by grain boundary movement. The DP nodule consists of alternate lamellae of the precipitate and the matrix respectively. The chemical driving force for DP is one of solute supersaturation. Although solute supersaturation is responsible for precipitation, it has to be coupled with another driving force to explain grain boundary migration. This coupling driving force has been identified to be diffusional coherency strain which has been verified to be active in diffusion induced grain boundary migration and liquid film migration."

We use the heat produced by the burning of acetylene in the flame of the oxyacetylene torch to make welds.||"CONT: The Welding and Metals Fabrication Program provides students with instruction, practical experience, and related theory in shielded metal arc welding, gas metal arc welding, flux-cored arc welding, gas tungsten arc welding, manual and automatic oxyacetylene burning, brazing, soldering, air carbon arc gouging, and plasma arc gouging and cutting."

Steelmaking||thin-slab casting||CORRECT||||||thin slab casting||CORRECT||DEF: The process of continuously casting slab of under two inches in thickness.||"CONT: Strip casting technology permits the production of hot strips, also referred to as hot rolled coiled steel, directly from the liquid crude steel. Casting and rolling are linked into one continuous operation. Strip casting technology is ... the last technology in realizing direct casting. ... direct casting has been realized in a step-wise fashion: the thickness of the sheet or strip cast has been reduced by three innovative technologies, conventional continuous casting, thin slab casting and strip casting technology .... The introduction of thin slab casting (1989) let the liquid steel be cast in thinner slabs .... Blooms and billets cannot be produced with a thin slab caster. Thin slab casting technology integrates casting and the finishing operations in the hot rolling section of a steel plant. The cast slabs are charged directly into a reheater and subsequently fed into the hot rolling mill. The reheating capacity for hot rolling the slabs is thus reduced."||OBS: This process is more efficient than the traditional hot rolling of eight to ten inch slab into narrower gauges.
Steelmaking||tin pot yield||CORRECT||||||||||"CONT: Coating weights: Pure tin coating on a hot-dip tin plate is mechanically distributed over sheet surface by tinning rolls. Due to nature of this tinning operation and elevated temperature of metal it is not possible to control, within close limits, tin coating weight. For these and other reasons, coating is measured and described by  tin pot yield method. Total weight (in pounds) of tin consumed in manufacture of one base box, is pot yield. Terms, charcoal plate and coke plate, which in last century described quality of iron used as a base metal, have now come to be applied to tin plate of certain coating thickness. Amount of coating on coke plates is generally between 1.24 and 2.5 pounds per base box - on charcoal plates between 3 pounds and 5 pounds per base box. For roofing applications, heavier charcoal weight coatings have always been preferred. Common cokes, 1.25 lb/base box. Standard cokes, 1.50 lb/base box; Best cokes, 1.70 lb/base box.  Kanners special cokes, 2.0 lb/base box. ... Weight of coating on an electrolytic plate is a measurement of amount of coating on both sides of sheet, expressed in grams per square meter. Prior to adoption of this system, a  pot yield method was used.

Short-ternes (terne plate) are no longer produced."||"CONT: Terne plate roofing sheets. All terne plate is produced by hot-dip process. Two product lines  short terne and  long terne are available.

Long terne is available in cut lengths up to 3||658 mm and coils, generally 15||240 mm in length."||"OBS: According to some authors,  short ternes and  long ternes differentiate themselves by the difference in the thickness of their tin coating.  Short refers to the weight of coating per basis box, and always to the thinner coatings, usually 40.5 m² (436 sq. ft.) of plate or sheet; usually 3.6 kg of coating metal is the limit for short terne tin plates, and for heavier plates the weight of coating may vary from two to five times this amount. According to other authors,  short ternes and  long ternes differentiate themselves by the difference in their linear dimensions. Short ternes commonly measure 0.5 X 0.7 m, whereas long ternes have dimensions which usually fall within the limits of 0.6 X 1.5 m to 1.2 X 3.7 m. It is possible that the latter characteristic (size) conditions the former one (coating weight), ending in the same result, the difference being simply in the approach chosen."

Formerly, there were two classes of terne-coated products: long terne sheet (sometimes called simply long ternes) which was a hot-dipped sheet-mill product that fell within the dimensional ranges covered by the uncoated-sheet commodities; and short ternes (also called terne plate) which was a hot-dipped tin-mill product in black-plate gages (thickness less than 0.36 mm (0.014 inch). Short-ternes (terne plate) are no longer produced."||"CONT: Terne plate roofing sheets. All terne plate is produced by hot-dip process. Two product lines  short terne and  long terne are available. The difference between the two products is largely one of size.  Short terne is generally available in the sizes 356 x 508 mm and 508 x 711 mm.  Long terne is available in cut lengths up to 3||658 mm and coils, generally 15||240 mm in length."||"OBS: According to some authors,  short ternes and  long ternes differentiate themselves by the difference in the thickness of their tin coating.  Short refers to the weight of coating per basis box, and always to the thinner coatings, usually 40.5 m² (436 sq. ft.) of plate or sheet; usually 3.6 kg of coating metal is the limit for short terne tin plates, and for heavier plates the weight of coating may vary from two to five times this amount. According to other authors,  short ternes and  long ternes differentiate themselves by the difference in their linear dimensions. Short ternes commonly measure 0.5 X 0.7 m, whereas long ternes have dimensions which usually fall within the limits of 0.6 X 1.5 m to 1.2 X 3.7 m. It is possible that the latter characteristic (size) conditions the former one (coating weight), ending in the same result, the difference being simply in the approach chosen."

At such high power levels, localized melting and even vaporization can be induced in a number of materials.

[Since it is an] ultra sensitive method of welding, this skill is now applied to medical parts, electronic components, sensitive finished machined surfaces, polished surfaces, and any surfaces that would not lend themselves to conventional welding. The science behind microwelding is due to the tighter control of the arc in close spaces. The less heat added to the part, the least amount of distortion will result. Minimal sink (sink marks on the material surface due to melting into the base metal) is maintained through this process. Ultimately, precision microwelds lead to less rework, which in turn assist in lower cost for machining. In fact, many microwelds can be finished by hand."
