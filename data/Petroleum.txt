The process relies on the splashing of the liquids to effect mixing. ... Splash blending can also be used to mix the additive with the fuel at on-site tanks. In this case the additive is added to, for example, a bulk fuel tank or bunker tank located at the site of end-use. The splashing of the liquids mixes the additives as the tank is being filled from a fuel distribution vehicle or pipeline. Fuel distribution vehicles can include trucks, rail cars, barges or the like."||"CONT: Ethanol cannot be moved effectively through today's pipeline system, as it tends to get pulled into the water that usually exists in petroleum pipelines and tanks. Instead, it is blended at terminals near the end users. Splash blending, in which ethanol is added directly to a tanker truck along with the base gasoline, is commonly used."

A multilateral well has more than one horizontal (or near horizontal) lateral drilled from a single site and connected to a single wellbore. A multibranch well has more then one branch drilled from a single site and connected to a single wellbore. Although not as pervasive in the offshore as in the onshore because of the necessity of pressure-sealed systems, multilateral and multibranch wells are expected to be more important factors in future offshore development."||"CONT: Horizontal drilling, with multi-leg wells and multi-fracturing techniques provides much greater access to the reservoir, and results in much better recovery rates."
Oil Drilling||multidirectional drilling||CORRECT||||||||||"CONT: To coincide with a change in ecological attitude, the oil industry has been able to develop new techniques when it comes to tapping hidden oil reserves.

The solution was a technique called navigational drilling (or Navi-drilling) that was used in the oil industry and, less often, in mining. ... Simply put, navi-drilling allows operators to begin drilling a new hole 500 to 600 metres below the surface by using a pre-existing  pilot hole. This significantly reduces costs as the same hole is used for up to six navi-drilling holes. A steerable motor with a rotor system turns a cutting bit. The motor is powered by hydraulic force created by the mixture of water and drilling muds pumped inside the drill string. The fluid is pumped through the motor and returns to the surface at a rate of up to 250 litres per minute. [Followed by an illustration of a schematic cross-section showing navi-drilling holes.]"||"CONT: Further deep drilling at Southwest Oyu will await the arrival of navigational drilling equipment, which will allow Ivanhoe to more accurately delineate the deeper portions of the high grade porphyry zone (in excess of one half of a mile deep)."||"CONT: Newbergh Industries Limited ( Newbergh ) has developed and patented a technology which will greatly enhance the steering currently being used in oil and gas field directional drilling. This technology, which is known under the acronym of  HANDS , which stands for Hydraulic Activated Navigational Drilling System, will be incorporated in a so-called benthousing, which will make this piece of equipment remote adjustable whilst drilling for the first time. Its implication will improve drilling performance in terms of speed as well as quality and will result in considerable cost savings for the oil companies and savings in energy to drill the bore holes."

Oil Production||microbial enhanced oil recovery||CORRECT||MEOR||CORRECT||||||"CONT: The mechanics of MEOR at a molecular level are really quite simple, but must be thoroughly understood to assess both the efficiency and the efficacy of the process. The microbes in MEOR are simply hydrocarbon-utilizing, non-pathogenic microorganisms which are endemic to, and are naturally-occurring in petroleum reservoirs. What this means is, they naturally exist in reservoirs, are safe for plants, animals and humans, and ingest hydrocarbons as a food source which they metabolize. As a result of this  digestive process, they then excrete bio-products such as alcohols, gases, acids, surfactants and polymers, which because of their origin are all natural and non-toxic. ... Changes in the Crude [:] The gases excreted by the microorganisms go immediately into solution in the crude, making it a solution gas drive reservoir once again. The gases, solvents and weak acids cause a reduction in the viscosity and the pour point of the crude, and an increase in its API (or specific) gravity. These three changes cause the oil to be thinner and to flow more freely. Some of the microorganisms inhibit the activity of SRB's, or sulfate-reducing bacteria, which also occur naturally in reservoirs, but cause corrosion in metal parts and produce the deadly H2S (hydrogen sulfide) gas. Changes in the Reservoir Rock [:] The surfactants, acids and solvents clean out the paraffin wax and the heavy crude depositions in the pores of the rock improving the permeability and partially restoring the original porosity of the rock. The polymers help modify the permeability of the rock by reducing the size of the molecules of reservoir fluids, and help prevent and control water-coning problems. The acids, solvents, alcohols and surfactants remove metal traces from the poral throats of the rock, helping to restore the original porosity and permeability of the reservoir rock."

Wascana Energy Inc. and Alberta Research Council invite you to attend an information session to describe the Toe-To-Heel Waterflooding (TTHW) process. ... Background With the advent of horizontal wells in Improved Oil Recovery of heavy oils, a change is taking place in the approach to improved recovery of oil. Currently, there is a move from displacing oil in a flood pattern from injector to producers over long distances (of the order of hundreds of meters) to short-distance oil displacement (SDOD) processes (typically over a few meters). Due to the high viscosity of heavy oil, the displacement to producers located long distance away tends to make waterflooding inappropriate. Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage, Vapor Extraction and Toe-To-Heel Displacement Processes (TTHDP) belong to the SDOD processes. TTHDP can be applied as a non-thermal recovery technology, such as Toe-To-Heel Waterflooding or as a thermal technology such as Toe-To-Heel Steamflooding and Toe-To-Heel Air Injection. More than 17 laboratory tests of Toe-To-Heel Waterflooding (TTHW) showed that this process will provide good results for lighter heavy oil reservoirs (with viscosity less than 1200 mPas). Hele Shaw model tests indicated ultimate recovery factors substantially higher for the TTHW, when compared to conventional waterflooding using vertical wells."||"OBS: See also  toe-to-heel oil recovery process.

They may be installed in either the pumphouse or on the dispensing platform. They operate on the reduced flow velocity principle which separates and eliminates air from the fuel. As the fuel enters the air release chamber (the diameter of which is much greater than the diameter of the inlet to the air release body), the velocity of the flow is greatly reduced allowing an interval of time for the air to separate from the fuel. The air, being lighter than the liquid, rises to the top of the chamber, where it remains until a sufficient quantity has accumulated to lower the liquid level, causing the float to drop, which in turn opens the vent valve and allows the accumulated air to escape. In most cases the line from the air vent is returned to the storage or scavenger tank to prevent spraying fuel into the surrounding area in case of a malfunction of the air release chamber."

After a portion of the reservoir has been satisfactorily saturated, the steam is turned off and the reservoir allowed to sit for several weeks. After it has been allowed to sit and soak up the steam and moisture, the production phase brings the bitumen to the surface. It either flows on its own, or is pumped up the well to the surface.

Its mature phase is generally accompanied by an increasing production of water or gas, plus the aging of surface and subsurface equipment. To revitalize mature fields, a series of technologies is developed to increase the final recovery factor through treatments on a field (the so-called tertiary petroleum recovery) or well (stimulation, recompletion, treatments and logging) scale, in addition to optimizing the techniques relating to oil lift, its surface flow and treatment."||"OBS: Many mature gas fields also have a fairly significant production decline, especially when development drilling has come to an end. These mature fields can be revitalized in many ways. In some instances, efforts are focused on the reservoir with further drilling to drain potentially unswept hydrocarbons with infill wells or horizontal laterals. The horizontal drilling might be from new wellbores or wells that are currently temporarily abandoned or near their economic limit. With the increase in horizontal-well activity, there is an abundance of new technology with advances in gravel-pack design, underbalanced drilling with coiled tubing, and coiled-tubing fracturing. Besides these production improvements, operators are revamping both downhole and surface facilities to help breathe new life into older fields. Advances are taking place in the areas of artificial lift, intelligent-well completions, expandable tubulars, and others."

Although a chemist would never confuse the terms dispersant and emulsifier, the former designating a product which encourages the distribution of finely divided solids in a fluid, either liquid or gas, the latter referring to a product which encourages the colloidal dispersion of one liquid in another, the terms are synonymous in the field of oil pollution control. This is explained by the following sentence taken from  The Control of oil pollution on the sea and inland waters , edited by J. Wardley-Smith (source COCOB):  It was found ... [that the product] when sprayed on to the oil, effectively softened and dispersed it by means of emulsification ... The dispersion is accomplished by products which emulsify the oil, i.e., emulsifiers. Dispersion is used in its general sense and hence dispersant simply means a product that causes spreading.

As the fuel enters the air release chamber (the diameter of which is much greater than the diameter of the inlet to the air release body), the velocity of the flow is greatly reduced allowing an interval of time for the air to separate from the fuel. The air, being lighter than the liquid, rises to the top of the chamber, where it remains until a sufficient quantity has accumulated to lower the liquid level, causing the float to drop, which in turn opens the vent valve and allows the accumulated air to escape. In most cases the line from the air vent is returned to the storage or scavenger tank to prevent spraying fuel into the surrounding area in case of a malfunction of the air release chamber."
