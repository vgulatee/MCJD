Baby and Child Care||Period of PURPLE CryingÂ®||"CORRECT||TRADEMARK"||||||||||"OBS: The Period of PURPLE CryingÂ® is the phrase used to describe the point in a babyâ€™s life when they cry more than any other time. This period of increased crying is often described as colic, but there have been many misunderstandings about what â€œcolicâ€? really is. The Period of PURPLE CryingÂ® is a new way to help parents understand this time in their babyâ€™s life, which is a normal part of every infantâ€™s development. It is confusing and concerning to be told your baby â€œhas colicâ€? because it sounds like it is an illness or a condition that is abnormal. When the baby is given colic medicine it reinforces the idea that there is something wrong with the baby when in fact the baby is going through a very normal developmental phase. That is why we prefer to refer to this time as the Period of PURPLE CryingÂ®. No, it is not because the baby turns purple when he/she cries but provides a meaningful and memorable way to describe what parents and their babies are going through. The Period of PURPLE CryingÂ® begins at about 2 weeks of age and continues until about 3-4 months."||OBS: The letters in PURPLE stand for P (Peak of crying); U (Unexpected); R (Resists soothing); P (Pain-like face); L (Long lasting); E (Evening).

It should be noted that no cut pile can be classified as being completely free of shading. These constructions are obtained by stuffing yarn into a steam box (stuffer box) and providing a kinked or curled yarn. The fiber is exposed to live steam to set yarn memory in this curled position. This curling of the fiber reduces light reflectance, thus reducing the appearance of footprints. Generally, when viewing a texture from the top, kinked yarns may provide a two-tone effect as a result of shade variations from reflected light."

Etiquette and Protocol (General)||Royal Victorian Chain||CORRECT||||||||||"OBS: The Royal Victorian Chain is an award, instituted in 1902 by King Edward VII as a personal award of the Monarch (i.e. not an award by the British or any other Commonwealth Realm government). Although it is similar in appearance to the Royal Victorian Order, the two awards are unrelated. The Royal Victorian Chain does not confer upon its recipients any style or title - in fact, the Chain is not even given a precedence within any Commonwealth honours system - but it represents a personal token of high distinction and esteem from the Monarch. The Chain can be conferred upon men and women, both of the Realms and foreign. The chain is in gold, decorated with motifs of Tudor rose, Thistle, Shamrock and Lotus Flower (symbolizing England, Scotland, Ireland and India respectively), and a crowned, red enamelled cipher of King Edward VII  ERI (Edwardus Rex Imperator), surrounded by a gold wreath for men, upon which the badge is suspended. The chain is worn around the collar by men, or with the four motifs and some chain links fixed to a riband in the form of bow (blue with red-white-red edges) on the left shoulder by women. However the Queen's sister Princess Margaret in later life wore her chain around the collar, as male recipients do."

And, because they can utilize waste heat as an energy source, they are extremely environmentally friendly. In addition, since thermoacoustic refrigerators do not use the compressors, lubricants, sliding seals, and other gizmos present in vapor compression refrigerators, the thermoacoustic refrigerator should be more reliable. In fact, a heat driven refrigerator does not need any moving parts in the refrigeration cycle! Finally, since thermoacoustic systems tend to work at higher frequencies and at single frequencies, noise and vibration control is actually easier than for a conventional refrigerator - so thermoacoustic refrigerators should be even quieter than the refrigerators of today."

Under the patronage of the Medicis, Florence became an important centre for embroidery. Prominent artists such as Raphael, were commissioned to make designs to be stiched by such men as Antonio Pollaiuolo, whose embroideries were recognised as important examples of Renaissance art. In Venice, typical openwork evolved into lace, removing threads and replacing them with stiches. Casalguidi is known for another distinct form of white linen embroidery and in Florence expensive silk and woollen threads were worked on canvas in a technique known today as  Bargello work after the palace there."

With this type of machine, the dough is run between the smooth rollers at increasingly thinner settings until it reaches the desired thickness. The sheets of dough are then fed through either pair of the notched rollers, which cut them into noodles.
