In the lung the accumulation often appears as macular lesions, usually in a centrilobular location, along the walls of bronchioles, but also along interlobular septa or in the subpleural space. This pigment is mainly composed of carbonaceous material and may originate from cigarette smoke (or other smoked drugs, such as crack cocaine), atmospheric pollution, residential exposure to wood (or biomass) smoke or occupational exposure to carbon-containing dusts, such as diesel exhaust, soot, fly ash, carbon black, graphite and coal. Thus a more or less marked degree of anthracosis may be found in nonsmoking urban residents from heavily polluted areas or in inhabitants (often females) of poor countries with a cold climate (so-called 'hut lung'). Anthracosis is only rarely associated with overt pulmonary disease, except after prolonged, heavy, usually occupational exposure, when the condition is preferably labelled as a pneumoconiosis, e.g. graphite pneumoconiosis (graphitosis) or coal workers pneumoconiosis. The latter pneumoconiosis is often called anthracosilicosis (particularly in continental Europe), because this pneumoconiosis has been considered to be caused predominantly by the silica content of coal dust. While this may be true in many instances, the use of anthracosilicosis to indicate coal worker's pneumoconiosis is probably not entirely appropriate, because the pathology of coal workers pneumoconiosis is different from that of silicosis."

In areas of very deep mining, as additional weight is supported by the pillars on the coal face, stresses may so build up that the yield point is reached. If the coal pillars, the roof, or the floor are able to yield gradually, the effects of the stresses are relieved by floor heaving, or by pillar or roof failure. Where the coal or the associated rocks are particularly strong and depths are much above average, these stresses may be relieved by rock bursts, which are relatively violent outbursts of the coal into the rooms and entries. Frequently, a large volume of gas (usually methane) is suddenly released during a rock burst in a coal mine."||"OBS: for  coal burst : Rock bursts and  coal bursts in coal mines are generally designated by the term  bumps or  bounces .

Non-Artesian Water Wells||pump surging||CORRECT||||||pumping and surging;raw hiding;rawhiding;raw-hiding||CORRECT;CORRECT;CORRECT;CORRECT||"CONT: Pump surging (sometimes called Rawhiding) involves the repeated pumping and resting of the well for well development purposes. A column of water that is withdrawn through a pump is allowed to surge back into the well by turning the pump on and off repeatedly. However, sufficient time for the pump motor to stop reverse rotation must be allowed, such that pump damage can be avoided. Occasionally, water is pumped to waste until it is clear of sediment before again shutting the pump off. This is done to permanently remove the sediments that are being developed by the backwashing action. The process continues until sufficient quantities of water produced are consistently clean."||CONT: Pumping.- Also referred to as raw hiding or pumping and surging.

Non-Artesian Water Wells||surge block||CORRECT||||||surge-block||CORRECT||"CONT: Surge-blocks, swabs, or plungers are disc shaped devices made to fit tightly within the well. Their edges are usually fitted with rubber or leather rings to make a tight seal against the well casing. Pipe sections are then attached to the surge-block to lower it into the well, above the well screen, and about 15 feet below the water level. The assembly is then repeatedly lifted up and down. The up and down action of the surge-block creates suction and compression strokes that force water in and out of the well through the screened interval, gravel pack, and aquifer. It works like a plunger in the way that it removes small obstructions and sediments from the well. The surge-block is slowly lowered each time resistance begins to decrease."||CONT: A rapid up and down motion of a surge block in the water of the well will give reversals of flow through the screen ...

Peat and Peat Bogs||The Mysterious Bog People: Rituals and Sacrifice in Ancient Europe||"CORRECT||CANADA"||||||||||"OBS: Exhibition of the Canadian Museum of Civilization.  Throughout large parts of Europe, wet landscape features such as rivers, brooks, wells and especially bogs had a particular meaning for people in the past. Since ancient times, people were attracted yet frightened by the misty environment of the bogs. They sacrificed their most valuable items in sacred bogs, rituals that are still mysterious to us today. Numerous artefacts discovered over the last two centuries in various parts of North-western Europe bear witness to the special significance of the bogs for the ancestors of many Europeans and North Americans. Pottery, flint tools, axes, jewellery, coins, and human bodies were sacrificed in the bogs to honour pagan gods. "

Underground Mining||paste backfilling system||CORRECT||||||paste backfill system;paste fill system||"CORRECT||"||"CONT: Paste backfill is defined as an engineered mixture of fine solid particles (with binder) and water, containing between 72% and 85% solids by weight. Particles in a paste mixture will not settle out of the mixture if allowed to remain stationary in a tank or in a pipeline. It can be placed in stopes with or without binder addition depending on the strength requirements for backfill. Improved pumping technology, environmental concerns and the need for a low cost/high strength fill in mines are driving mine operators to consider paste backfill as a tailings management and mine backfill alternative. The main advantages and disadvantages of a paste backfill system over a conventional hydraulic backfill plant are generally accepted as: ... higher strengths can be achieved with an equivalent cement content; drainage of water and slimes from the fill are minimized, reducing the need for bulkhead construction and extensive drainage works. This feature also reduces maintenance on sumps and mine de-watering pumps; in some cases, unclassified tailings can be used to make paste rather than just the coarse fraction as is the case for hydraulic backfill; shorter stope cycle times can be achieved because an equivalent strength can be achieved in a shorter time with paste backfill; paste backfill systems achieve lower porosities than conventional fill thereby increasing the tonnage of material that can be disposed of underground; and, since paste backfill is deposited as a non-segregated mass of backfill (because cement particles are not displaced by the internal movements of the draining water), more predictable strength properties for the fill can be achieved."||"CONT: Paste backfilling of mines. A number of mines are installing paste fill systems to replace the current sand fill method. The justification and economies of this conversion include: higher production levels (less wait for dewatering), increased grade of ore to the mill, decrease of stope ore left as pillars, improved haulage with the removal of excess moisture, increased filling rates, and a higher strength fill with less waiting time. The unique problems associated with paste fill applications range from extremely rapid system wear to paste separation and system blockage."

It has largely been replaced by mechanized methods ... It is applicable to mineral deposits with regular boundaries and steep dip hosted in a competent rock mass. Also, the blasted ore must not be affected by storage in the slopes ... Its most prominent feature is the use of gravity flow for ore handling: ore from stopes drops directly into rail cars via chutes obviating manual loading ...

In areas of very deep mining, as additional weight is supported by the pillars on the coal face, stresses may so build up that the yield point is reached. If the coal pillars, the roof, or the floor are able to yield gradually, the effects of the stresses are relieved by floor heaving, or by pillar or roof failure. Where the coal or the associated rocks are particularly strong and depths are much above average, these stresses may be relieved by rock bursts, which are relatively violent outbursts of the coal into the rooms and entries. Frequently, a large volume of gas (usually methane) is suddenly released during a rock burst in a coal mine."||"OBS: for  coal burst : Rock bursts and  coal bursts in coal mines are generally designated by the term  bumps or  bounces . A large proportion of these  bumps or  bounces are actually  coal bursts due to fracturing of pillars and remnants and need not involve any fracturing of roof or floor rock."
